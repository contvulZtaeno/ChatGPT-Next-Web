The Force Powers Mod is a collection of mods that add new and improved force powers to Kotor. You can choose from four different mods that each offer a different set of powers:
 
- Four Force Powers by InSidious: This mod adds four new, three-tier force powers to Kotor - Rage, Scorch, Revitalise and Floating Lightsabres. Rage is a dark side power that boosts your physical attributes and speed, but drains your health and mental attributes afterwards. Scorch is a universal power that projects a spray of flame at your target, causing damage. Revitalise is a light side power that allows you to restore life to any non-droid party member killed in combat. Floating Lightsabres is a universal power that spawns one, two, or three lightsabres to help you in combat, depending on your level.
- Full Force Mod by Team Hssiss: This mod adds 15 new force powers to Kotor, some of which are exclusive to certain prestige classes. Some of the new powers include Shatterpoint, which deals massive damage to an enemy's weak point; Force Crush, which lifts and crushes an enemy with the force; Force Enlightenment, which activates all your light side buffs at once; Force Storm, which unleashes a powerful lightning storm that hits multiple enemies; and Force Sight, which allows you to see through stealth and illusions.
- Extended Duration Force Powers by DarthParametric: This mod increases the duration of some of the existing force powers in Kotor, such as Valor, Aura, Shield, Speed, and Energy Resistance. This makes them more useful and convenient on higher difficulties, where you need all the advantages you can get.
- Force Power Feats by Darth333: This mod adds new feats that allow you to use certain force powers more effectively. For example, you can get feats that increase the damage or duration of your force powers, reduce their cost or casting time, or make them affect more targets or have additional effects.

With these mods, you can enhance your Kotor experience with more force powers that suit your playstyle and preferences. Whether you want to unleash your dark side fury, heal and protect your allies, or simply have more fun with the force, these mods have something for you.
 
To install these mods, you need to download them from their respective websites and follow their instructions. You may also need some tools like KotOR Tool or TSL Patcher to make them compatible with each other and with other mods you may have. Always make a backup of your game files before installing any mod.
 
Enjoy your enhanced Kotor experience with Force Powers Mod!
